This plugin will add the functionality to blacklist the customer from checking out.

== Description ==
An extension for the WooCommerce that allows for the blacklisting customer details (Billing Phone, Billing Email and IP address). Admin can blacklist the customer information manually through the setting or can edit the order page and black the customer's details into blacklist.

Another key features of this plugin is that it tracks the number of fraud order attempts for payment gateways like Credit Card, Electronic Check and blacklist the customer if the number of fraud attempts exceeds the limit set in the backend setting. When customer knows the correct patterns for payment fields of electronic check or credit card, they may try to create to multiple failed order. This plugin will track those attempts, cancel the order automatically and black the customer automatically from checking out in future.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I add zipcode or city Address in the blacklist? =
Yes. This feature is available from version 2.1.0.

= Can I use email wildcard for blacklisting?
Yes, absolutely. This feature is available from version 2.4.0. You can enter the wildcard entry without an asterisk (*). E.g. If you put "john", It will block orders from every email containing the string "john", john@gmail.com, john@yahoo.com, johndoe@anyhting.com, avfjohndev@anything.com and so on.

= What is the basic rule for address blacklisting? =
The full syntax for block by address is,
“Street address 1, Address 2, City, State, ZIPCODE, Country”

Also, the partial address can also be used. For example, “Springfield, US” will block every order in every city named Springfield in the US;
Likewise, “90210” will block all orders to that zip code.

Similarly, “Springfield, IL” will block all the orders from an address in a city named “Springfield” in the state “Illinois”.

“Springfield” will block every order from “Springfield”.
“IL” will block every order from the state “IL”.
“US” will block orders from country “United States” and so on.

So, the very simple rule is, you can create any combination of address fields “Street address 1, Address 2, City, State, ZIPCODE, Country” separated by a comma as needed.

= How do we blacklist the customer's detail? =
There are three ways to blacklist the customer. First, open the order edit page, choose the option "Blacklist Customer" in the "order actions" section and update the order page and it will add the customer's details into blacklist. Second, navigate to Woocommerce > Settings > Blacklisted Customers tab. You will see three different textarea fields for "Email" "Phones" & "IP Address". You can manually edit those setting to update the blacklisted customers.

= Is there wildcard rule for address blacklisting? =
Yes, There is. Wildcard must be in the format of "%address%"; enclosed by "%". For example; If you put the "%Springfield%" as a wildcard rule for address, It will block the order if there is any match of "Springfield" within any of customer\'s address(Street address, address line 2, city etc.)

= Is there auto blacklisting system as well? =
Yes, there is. But this auto system will be in action only for those payment gateways which authorizes the payment details and charge instantly (Electronic Check, Credit Card) etc.

= What is the process for automatic blacklisting system? =
Let us take an example of Electronic check payment gateway. When customer successfully validates the payment fields like "Route Number", "Account Number" & "Check Number" fields, those values will be sent for authorizing. If Bank couldn't authorize those customer details, the woo commerce will mark the order as "Failed". Then, same customer may try to create the multiple number of "Failed" orders. This plugin will track that behavior and blacklist the customer from future checkout.

= Can I remove the customer details from blacklist? =
Yes, absolutely. You can either edit the setting option in "Woocommerce > Setting > Blacklisted Customers" or you can do it from the order edit page under "Order Actions" option.

= Can I prevent the customer based on their previous order status? =
Yes, absolutely. You can choose the multiple orders statuses in setting and this is completely compatible with <a href="https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-order-status-manager/" target="_blank">WooCommerce Order Status Manager</a>.

= Can I whitelist customer details or anything? =
Yes. From version 2.3.0, you can whitelist the payment gateways and white list specific users. You can either user email address or WP user Id.
